To Do:

- a)  User has to call for PForDelta and create a fresh hash map after the day's check manually. I can probably call PForHash as a library inside PForDelta and overwrite the previous hashmap and master hash file but I am trying to learn if there is a better way.

- b)  Learning PySide and PyQt to make it GUI (makes me pull my hair out)

- c)  Learning API integrations and how to host from clouds so we will see about that (in a 100years for sure)

- d) Need to add a save as csv argument

- e) If a complete subdirectory is added, should say just that and not list all files to be individually added
